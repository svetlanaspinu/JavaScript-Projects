# JavaScript-Projects
This Repository contains examples how to use functions, math operators, string methods, dictionaries in JavaScripts and projects I made using JavaScripts are:
1.	Pizza Project: this project is a menu used to order pizza with a various selection of toppings.
It then takes the input information and calculates a price for the order.
2.	Tic_Tac_Toe Game: the classic game of tic-tac-toe randomly rolls dice to select which of the two players goes first and then users are off playing the classic game. Users can decide which token each player wants to use and then the winner is celebrated with music and flashing lights.
3.	Calculator: a basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply and divide on a sleek web version of a calculator.
